The Maori Language Commission, in partnership with PB Tech, has created a keyboard layout for New Zealand. It is a keyboard for every New Zealander; whether you only use English, want to dabble in te reo Maori, or use te reo Maori all day.
What is it exactly?
The te reo Maori keyboard is a combination of characters printed on your laptop or desktop keyboard as well as supporting software (keyboard definitions). The definitions for Chrome devices are available for download when you scan the QR code on the box of your new device.
